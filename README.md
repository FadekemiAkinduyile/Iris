# Model Deployment using Streamlit App on Iris Dataset 

## Overview
This project is a simple web application built with Streamlit to explore and visualize the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Demo
You can access the live demo of the Iris Dataset Explorer [here]([your-streamlit-app-url](https://qfj3k6irek4wgytfuq8wek.streamlit.app/)).
